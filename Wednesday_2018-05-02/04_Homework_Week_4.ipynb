Use a list to memorize the lengths of numbers you already tested and use it as a look-up table when you test larger numbers.

    "## The sieve of Eratosthenes (20 points)\n",
    "In this exercise you need to write a proggram implementing the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). It is an old and very efficient algorithm to determine all prime numbers up to a given upper limit `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is described as follows:\n",
    "1. Create a list of consecutive integers from `2` through `n`: `[2, 3, 4, ..., n]`.\n",
    "2. Initially, let `p` equal `2`, the smallest prime number.\n",
    "3. Enumerate the multiples of `p` by counting to `n` from `2p` in increments of `p`, and mark them in the list (these will be `2p`, `3p`, `4p`, ...; the `p` itself should not be marked).\n",
    "4. Find the first number greater than `p` in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let `p` now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.\n",
    "5. When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the following tasks:\n",
    "- Write a function `eratosthenes` which takes the upper limit `n` as mandatory argument and returns a list of all prime numbers up to `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use your function to solve [problem 10](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10) of ProjectEuler.\n",

    "  prime_cand = list(range(n + 1))   # prime number candidates\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  I deliberately create a list containing `[0, 1]` here. It makes the problem easier to solve with the next hint. \n",

    "2. You can mark numbers in the list as non-prime (step 3 in the algorithm) by setting corresponding list entries to zero. For the marking itself, [this review question](04_Review_Questions.ipynb/#slice_assignment) might come in handy.\n",

    "## Birthday Probabilities (20 points)\n",
    "Computer simulations are very useful to obtain propabilities for events whose analytical treatment is difficult or impossible. I assume that everybody of you is familiar with the so-called *birthday paradox*.\n",
    "In a room with 23 people, the probability that two of them have the same birthday already exceeds 50%! While the classical birthday problem is still easily solved anlytically, this is no longer true for the more general problem *What is the probability that in a group of $n$ people, $k$ ($k\\geq 2$) or more of them have the same birthday?* We want to investigate this problem with a computer simulation in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate the probability by generating random samples of $n$ peoples birthdays (lists of $n$ random integer numbers between 1 and 365. We neglect leap years!) and checking for *matches*. A random birthday list contains a match if the same number appears $k$ or more times in it. If we have $N$ lists with $n$ random birthdays each and we find a total of $m$-matches in these $N$ lists, the desired probability is approximated by $P_{k}(n)=m/N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `birthday_probability` which takes the three mandatory arguments $n$ (number of people), $k$ (at least $k$-peopleshare the same birthday) and $N$ (number of samples). It should return an estimate for $P_{k}(n)$. Find $n_{50}$ such that $P_{\\rm triple birthday}(n_{50})\\approx 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "1. Implement the function `birthday_probability` as described above.\n",
    "2. Test your function with the case $k=2$ and find $n_{50}$ such that $P_{k}(n_{50}\\approx 0.5$. It is well known that $n_{50}=23$ in this case.\n",
    "3. Find $n_{50}$ for the $k=3$ case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- The function `random.randint` within the `random`-module. generates one random integer number in a given range. You can use a list comprehension to generate the required list of $n$ random numbers.\n",
    "- Use at least $N>1000$ samples to estimate the propability but experiment with other numbers to investigate when the results are stable.\n",
    "- Within this weeks *Review Questions* you already wrote a function `triple` to test whether a list contains three or more times. Generalise that function for this exercise."
