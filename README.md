# Programming in Python (Bonn; Summer 2018)
Materials for the course 'Programming in Physics and Astronomy with C++ or Python' (AIfA; Summer Term 2018)

## Goal of the course
The goal of the course is to teach physics/astronomy-students on the
master level how to efficiently and flexibly solve scientific
programming problems with the easy-to-learn, high-level programming
language Python. The course specifically addresses students with no
prior programming experience.

## Where and when?
 - Where: AIfA CIP-Pool; Room 0.007 in the AIfA ground floor
 - When: 1:00 pm s.t. - 4:00 pm on each Wednesday (except public holidays) in the 2018 Summer Term

## Preconditions for the course
 - You need a Bonn University account to participate in the course! This consists of a login name (it starts with the letters *s6*) and an accompanying password. Please make sure that you have the accounf **and** the password ready for the first lecture on the 9th of April!
  **Important Note:** The Bonn university account is *different* from your AIfA computer login account (if you have one!). The AIfA account is **NOT** sufficient for the course!
- I assume basic familiarity with the *Linux* operating system, especially using the *Unix*-command line.

## Computer / Laptop setup
Each student will work actively with an own computer in the AIfA CIP-Pool. All necessary software is already installed on the computers. For those, who would like to setup own computers/laptops with the proper software, I provide necessary information [here](https://github.com/terben/Programming_in_Python_Bonn_Summer_2018/tree/master/computer_setup).
