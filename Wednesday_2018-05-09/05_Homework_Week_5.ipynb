    "**Remark:** This exercise does not require you to write some code but to analyse a given program and to describe your findings. Please do this within a jupyter-notebbok or within a text-file with the name `merge_sort_group_X.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After examining one of the simplest sorting-algorithms (selection-sort) two weeks ago, we now repeat this exercise with one of the best sorting strategies, the `merge-sort`. As described in class, advanced sorting algorithms perform their task with a *divide-and-conquer* strategy. They continuously split up the task to smaller array-sizes and combine intermediate results in a clever manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Have a look at the code [merge-sort.py](code/merge-sort.py) and run it on your computer. You see a sorted list of 50 integer numbers. Study the code and describe the sorting procedure in plain English. The code has some commented print-statements which you can uncomment to easier see what is going on. Can you tell, where this algorithms name (merge-sort) comes from?\n",
    "2. The code `merge-sort.py` contains an outer `for`-loop which sorts lists of different input lists and stores the necessary loop-runs in a list `runs`. To use this loop, comment the lines `N = [50]` and `print(numbers[0])` (just at the end before the plotting commands). Uncomment the line `#N = list(range(2,3000,50))` (see also comments within the code). The result of the code in this case are two plots showing loop-runs vs. input-list-length ($n$) and loop-runs / $n$ vs input-list-length. Can you guess the complexity of the algorithm from these plots?\n",
    "3. The plots from (2.) show significant jumps at discrete list-lengths. At which lengths do these jumps appear and why?\n",
    "4. `merge-sort` is significantly quicker than `selection-sort` for large input lists. What is the price for the speed-increase? (**Hint:** What do you look at (besides CPU-power) when you buy a computer?) "

    "We have a set $B$ of coins, e.g. for the Euro $B_{\\rm Euro}= \\{1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200\\}$ (with the unit of cent). The goal of this exercise is to write Python-code which reports the smallest number of coins $N_{\\rm min}$ with which a given amount of money $Z_0$ can be paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For all currencies in use, the following, intuitive algorithm gives the correct (and unique) answer:\n",
    "  1. Take from $B$ the coin with the highest possible value value ($M\\leq Z_0$) as often as possible, i.e. unitl $Z_0-(n_1+1)\\cdot M\\leq 0$. If $Z_0-(n_1+1)\\cdot M = 0$, the algorithm terminates. In that case, we just take $(n_1+1)\\cdot M$ to pay the requested amount. If $Z_0-(n_1+1)\\cdot M < 0$, we take coin $M$ $n_1$-times and set $Z_1 = Z_0-n_1\\cdot M$.\n",
    "  2. If necessary, we repeat (A) with $Z_1$ instead of $Z_0$ and go on until $Z_m=0$ (with $m\\geq 1$).\n",
    "  3. The number of coins that we asked for is $N_{\\rm min}=n_1+\\dots +(n_m+1)$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Example:** $B=B_{\\rm Euro}$ and $Z_0=47$: $Z_0=2\\cdot 20 + 1\\cdot 5 + 1\\cdot 2$. Hence, we need at least 4 coins to pay 47 cents.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Your tasks:**\n",
    "  1. Reason why the algorithm always terminates.\n",
    "  2. Write a Python-program (call it `money_1_group_X.py` if you write a script) that implements the algorithm above and reports $N_{\\rm min}$ for a given $Z_0$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Consider $B=\\{2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11\\}$ and $Z_0=15$. The algorithm of (1.) would lead to the solution set $L=\\{11, 2, 2\\}$ (3 coins). Obviously, the alternative solutions $L_1=\\{10, 5\\}$ and $L_2=\\{7, 8\\}$ (2 coins) are better.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Your tasks:**\n",
    "  1. Develop and describe an algorithm to obtain $N_{\\rm min}$ for an arbitrary base-set $B$.\n",
    "  2. Implement your algorithm in a Python-program (call it `money_2_group_X.py` if you write a script).\n",
    "  3. test your program thoroughly!\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Notes:**\n",
    "  1. Do not give up if you are stuck with the task and discuss within your group. It is not an easy one!\n",
    "  2. The exercise can be considered a generalisation of the Chicekn-McNuggets exercise from two weeks ago. In that task, the base-set of package sizes was fixed but the coin base-set can be aribitrary here. This adds significant complexity to the problem. As in the McNuggets task, you need to try **all reasonable possibilities in brute-force** - but see the hint below.\n",
    "  3. We ask **only** for the number of coins $N_{\\rm min}$ **but not** for the coin-combination(s)!\n",
    "  4. Note that the problem can have **no solution** at all! For $B=\\{2\\}$, you obviously cannot pay any uneven amount of money. Your algorithm must correctly treat and report such cases.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Hint:**\n",
    "  As you probably already noticed, the main issue is **how to obtain and try all reasonable possibilities** to pay $Z_0$ with the least possible number of coins. Here is a proposal to get you going:\n",
    "  1. The base-set $B$ gives those amounts that can be paid **with exactly one coin**! If $Z_0$ is in this set or if it is smaller than all the coins in $B$, the algorithm terminates. In the latter case, the problem has no solution.\n",
    "  2. Construct a list of those amounts that can be paid **with exactly two coins** $\\dots$\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Bonus task:**\n",
    "Extend your solution of (2.) in a new program (call it `money_3_group_X.py` if you write a script) which reports $N_{\\rm min}$ **and** the combination of coins which solves the task. If there are several possibilities (as in the example of (2.)), you only need to give one.\n"
