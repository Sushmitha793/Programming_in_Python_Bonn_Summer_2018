    "- You only learn a programming language by actively praticing and using it! I therefore **strongly** advise you to work on the homework problems.\n",
    "- You are required to hand in group solutions (three students per group) - Please put the names of the students involved and the group number clearly within the Jupyter notebooks or as comments within scripts.\n",
    "- You need to reach 50 % of all possible homework points at the end of the term as one condition for your credit-points.\n",
    "- Please discuss the problems with your student peers in case of problems.\n",
    "- Please send your solutions via mail to Aakash and myself. Collect all your notebooks/scripts in **a single** Unix-gzipped Unix-tarfile with the name `group_X_submission_Week_Y.tgz` (`X` being your group number and `Y` the week-number of the homework sheet) that you send us. Please **do not** send us several individual files for your homework submission but **only one** tar-file!\n",
    "  - Aakash will correct them and give you feedback on your solutions. I also will talk about common problems in later classes.\n",
    "  - You can hand in Jupyter notebooks (please only **one** with solutions for all homework tasks) or Python scripts.\n",
    "  - If you hand in scripts, please use the proposed names to make live easier for us!\n",
    "  - Your code needs to be well and appropriately commented! \n",
    "  - Please note within your script or notebook, how much time you needed for the task. We want to get a better feeling on the work-load we ask for."
